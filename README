This is a custom implementation of the already built in malloc, free, calloc, realloc functions in c. My implementation keeps track of number of allocations, size of memory, failed allocations and size of failed allocations. it also prints reports of what you have called. It uses a linked list to keep track of the memory allocation pointers and their size. This keeps the memory allocation to be seen as a "Contiguous block" even though in physical memory it isn't.
